# Bacchus Group Project - Red Team

BEFORE BEGINNING:
    
    ---Always run all python scripts from the command line, not your IDE.  Running in VS Code has given odd results.

    ---bacchus_reports.py relies on the pandas library to show most of the reports.
       If you do not have pandas, the only report you will be able to view is the Overdue Supplies report.
       And only if you select "list" when prompted.
    
THEREFORE, FOLLOW THESE STEPS:

        ---Run "python3 bacchus_install.py" from the command line to drop, recreate, and fill the database automatically with the required updates.

        ---Run "pip install pandas" in the command line if you don't have pandas already.

        ---Finally, run "python3 bacchus_reports.py" in the command line and view the reports :)
